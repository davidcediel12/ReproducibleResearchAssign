# Assignment week 2 Reproducible Research

In this repo, I'm using the activity data provided in the assignment page for make a reproducible research using Knitr and R markdown. 

The unique script is **PAI_1_template.Rmd**, Knitr build a lot of folders, you can ignore them, all the instructions and explanations are in the R markdown.
